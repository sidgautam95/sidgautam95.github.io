I am a Ph.D. candidate (fifth year) in the Department of
[Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering](https://cmse.msu.edu/)
at Michigan State University. I am a member of the
[Signals, Learning, and Imaging (SLIM)](https://www.egr.msu.edu/slimgroup/)
group, advised by
[Prof. Saiprasad Ravishankar](https://sites.google.com/site/sairavishankar3/).

My research interests lie in computational imaging, inverse problems,
and medical imaging, with a focus on MRI acquisition and reconstruction,
scan-adaptive sampling methods, and learning-based reconstruction algorithms.
I am particularly interested in combining signal processing, optimization,
and machine learning for accelerated and robust imaging.

I received my M.S. in
[Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/)
from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2020, where I worked on
computational electromagnetics and microwave remote sensing under the supervision
of [Dr. Uday K. Khankhoje](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/uday/index.html).
