I am a first year PhD student in the department of [Computational Mathematics Science and Engineering](https://cmse.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University. At MSU, I have been a part of the [Signals, Learning, and Imaging (SLIM)](https://www.egr.msu.edu/slimgroup/) group headed by [Prof. Saiprasad Ravishankar](https://sites.google.com/site/sairavishankar3/) where I develop image reconstruction algorithms for MRI and X-ray CT applications.


I obtained my MS degree in [Electrical Engieering](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/) from Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2020. During my MS, I worked in the area of computational electromagnetics and microwave remote sensing under the guidance of [Prof. Uday Khankhoje](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/uday/index.html) at the [Numerical Electromagnetics and Optics (NEMO)](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/uday/group.html) Lab.
