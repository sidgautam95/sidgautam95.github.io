I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of [Computational Mathematics Science and Engineering](https://cmse.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University. At MSU, I have been a part of the [Signals, Learning, and Imaging (SLIM)](https://www.egr.msu.edu/slimgroup/) group headed by [Prof. Saiprasad Ravishankar](https://sites.google.com/site/sairavishankar3/). My research interests include computational imaging, signal processing, and machine learning.


I obtained my master's in [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/) from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2020. During my master's degree, I worked in computational electromagnetics and microwave remote sensing with [Dr. Uday K Khankhoje](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/uday/index.html).
